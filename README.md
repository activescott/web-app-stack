# activescott-web-app-stack

This project is intended to be a template for using [Architect](https://arc.codes/) on the server and React on the client for a web application. It uses TypeScript on both the server and the client.

## Goals

The goal is to make it quick and easy to start a new web application with the most basic functionality that any application needs set up and ready to go.

## Stack

**[Architect](https://arc.codes/)** provides lightweight infrastructure as code (IaC) deployment for an AWS-based backend. It provides support for TypeScript-based serverless functions on Lambda/APIG, DynamoDB, SQS, Static assets, and more. It's really a lightweight facade over cloudformation and provides [IaC extensibility via macros](https://arc.codes/primitives/macros).
Architect also supports multiple environments and local development.

**React** needs no introduction. This repo basically integrates [Create React App's TypeScript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) (including [a router](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-router)) into Architect's deployments.

**Bootstrap** for styling - because even though it is old, it's not dated :)

**Policy Structure** [A fork of Osano's Cookie Consent library](https://github.com/activescott/cookieconsent) is built in to ensure users are aware of cookies and a placeholder for your Terms of Service (see `client/src/pages/policy/terms.tsx`) and Privacy Policy (`client/src/pages/policy/privacy.tsx`) pages are included.

**Layout** There is a basic layout pattern implemented in react. See `client/src/components/layout.tsx`. Also incorporates [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) to handle `head`.

**Hygene** Linting of all files is handled with a combo of eslint & prettier. See `lint*` scripts in `package.json`.

## Getting Started

To run the base stack as is, run the following commands:

    npm run install-all
    npm start

## Usage

### To add a new page

1. Add it to `client/src/pages` as `mypage.tsx`
2. Add a route for the page in `client/src/App.tsx` (this allows react-router to handle it)
3. Add a serverless function for the route's path in `app.arc` that returns react-app's `index.html` OR copy `index.html` to that path in `client/public/...` so that index.html is always returned if someone navigates directly to the route's path on the server (see https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#serving-apps-with-client-side-routing for details)

**NOTE**: We use the `spa` support in Architect to force all 404s to just return `index.html` which supports our react-client-app (where client routing shows the right thing based on the route). This has a couple side-effects:

1. You don't get clean 404 when it should be a 404. Instead the client routing just kind of poops a blank page out.
2. If we used static assets (just put a copy of index.html) then it would be possible to leverage cloudfront for much faster support of the non-404 files. See fingerprinting at https://arc.codes/reference/arc/static and then you could front-end it with cloudfront and more at https://docs.begin.com/en/static-assets/working-with-static-assets and https://arc.codes/primitives/cdn
   For info on `spa` and how to turn off the "return index.html by default" behavior see https://arc.codes/reference/functions/http/node/proxy

### To add new configuration - via environment variable

See architects [`arc env` docs](https://arc.codes/docs/en/reference/cli/env#the-arc-env-file). Note `testing` is local dev. As is typical the [Begin Docs on Environment Variables](https://docs.begin.com/en/getting-started/environments) are also more helpful.

To add a new variable to test name `FOO` with value `myvalue`:

```
arc env staging FOO myvalue
```

## Quick References

Some super helpful references to keep handy:

- https://arc.codes/docs/en/reference/runtime/node and https://arc.codes/docs/en/reference/runtime/node#arc.http.async in particular as arc.http.async has a few handy tidbits like support for `request.session`.

## Roadmap

- [+] Bootstrap
- [+] Get two pages working and routing between them.
- [+] Layout:

  - [+] Add components for Layout & Head (ala [next/head](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head)) to make it easy to have a common layout across all pages.

- [+] Document the steps to add a new page.

- [+] demo of a client-side fetching api data in the `/data` page
- [+] fix: footer policy link color
- [+] fix: path for cookieconsent `/static/vendor/cookieconsent/cookieconsent.min.js` (is it deployed? Is SVGInjector deployed?)
- [+] fix: no more console warnings
- [+] fix: hamburger menu dropdown in a responsive view for narrow mobile clients

- [+] chore: code separated into clean `/client` and `/server` root directories
- [+] feat: bundle static assets (js, css, images) instead of using PUBLIC_URL as described at https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/#when-to-use-the-public-folder

- [+] Allow adding multiple OAuth Authorization servers to allow a user to authenticate:

  - [+] feat: CSRF tokens to protect against login attacks: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html
  - [+] feat(authentication): configuration for client ID & secret for google
  - [+] feat: DDB tables to store user and table to store tokens by provider
  - [+] feat: google OAuth working (with unit tests that mock google & user interactions)
  - [+] feat: user can use one or more OAuth providers with simple configuration
    - [+] Write session cookie as a separate cookie from architect session obj (assume lambda proxy types directly)
    - [+] Ensure that accounts are linked by sessionid (rather than email address)
      - [+] Store `sub` claim as part of token.
      - [+] redirect handler should lookup by `sub` claim not `email` claim.
      - [+] fix: session cookie is signed
    - [+] Ensures User's ID is preserved with multiple providers (multiple tokens for a single user)
  - [+] feat: response_mode is an environment variable (removes specialization for Sign in with Apple)

- [+] chore: github ci tests and protected main branch

  - [+] chore: posts to github releases (not to npm)

- [+] feat: profile menu w/ login/logout

  - [+] feat: logout endpoint (clears the session)

- [+] feat: CSRF token middleware in all state-changing APIs:

  - [+] CSRF server support: automatic detection/rejection (see requireCsrfHandlerFactory)
  - [+] CSRF client support: Automatic inclusion of the token (see fetchWithCsrf)

- [+] feat: ability to delete current user's linked identity
- [+] feat: ability to delete current user

- UserContext:

  - [+] feat: UserContext available as a react context so that client side app always has access to user/auth when authenticated (see alert genie, but no need for auth0)
  - [+] feat: all local API requests in `client/src/lib/useApiHooks.ts` use accessToken
  - [+] feat: login/logout pages
  - [+] feat: Avatar and login/logout/profile stuff in header

- [+] chore: upgrade architect
- [ ] chore: set up automatic deployment to staging in "staging" branch and production in "main" branch
  - aws secrets to GH secrets
  - oauth secrets to gh secrets
    - build `arc env` script to set up configuration environment
  - staging branch deploys to staging
  - main branch deploys to production
  - production needs a sane CNAME
  - update readme to note deployment steps

- [ ] feat: extract lambda/middleware into new package (@web-app-stack/lambda-auth)
- [ ] chore: basic unit tests (the server is thoroughly tested with unit tests, the client no-so-much)
- [ ] chore: git hooks for linting
- [ ] chore: git hooks for unit tests
- [ ] chore: move useApiHooks and ~~useScript hooks~~ into new package @activescott/react-hooks?

### Future

- [ ] feat: Implement PKCE: As the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] server responses are unchanged by this specification, client implementations of this specification do not need to know if the server has implemented this specification or not and SHOULD send the additional parameters as defined in Section 4 to all servers. Unclear who all supports it. PKCE will become mandatory with OAuth 2.1.
- [ ] feat: HMR for react-app while using architect's sandbox (so API's still work) ðŸ¤”
- [ ] chore: Integration tests for pages (see puppeteer, https://arc.codes/guides/testing)
- [ ] chore: Automated test to detect console warnings (puppeteer? part of unit test fixture?)
- [ ] chore: Integration tests for api (see https://arc.codes/guides/testing)
- [ ] feat: server-side rendering for react (like Next.js, see https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/server-rendering)
